Concept Simulations/Demonstrations for Maths/Science/I.T Using a Game Engine (UE4)



 
Millions of students and parents pay their fair share for their, or their child's, education. Furthermore, according to ACARA (https://www.acara.edu.au/reporting/national-report-on-schooling-in-australia-2013/funding-australia-s-schools/an-overview-of-government-funding-of-schools), the Australian state and federal government provided $36.9 million to Government schools and $11.1 million to non-Government schools, a total of roughly $48 million, in 2012-13. Whilst all this money is being funded and paid, there are still students who struggle to keep up with or comprehend the content they are being presented.
 
This project consists of providing a visual and interactive perspective of a variety of some of the simplest concepts in maths, science and I.T to help educators/teachers explain content to their students. This can, therefore, be iterated and improved for many more complex concepts. This may also be a crucial resource for students to help them understand concepts better or improve upon their knowledge of a concept by having the ability to be interactive with the simulations.
 
This idea provides a base for the education department to expand upon wherein educators are encouraged to create their own unique simulations of a concept or simply customise the settings of a specific simulation/demonstration to fit their purpose of the content being delivered to students. While there may be some constraints to the limits to how far the demonstration can be extended, all the simulations are interactive in some form and can be customised for the purpose of the demonstration regardless if a student or educator decides to use it.
 
This is interesting as it provides another unique way of learning and teaching in the education department. Educators and teachers can use this tool as a companion for their explanation of a concept or to reinvent the way a concept is taught by showcasing a variety of demonstrations to prove a single concept.
 
A number of prototype demonstrations/simulations will be created to showcase how game engines can be used to create simple math/science/I.T concepts. The Unreal Engine 4 (UE4, version 4.21.2) game engine will be used to create these prototypes. UE4’s blueprints, an object-oriented programming language, will be used for the entire development of the prototype.
 
By using this approach, the industry has the opportunity to save money on purchasing equipment that will eventually be thrown out and use the money to purchase a cheaper alternative that can be used and kept for longer than physical equipment, which is as effective if not more effective than physical equipment. This will also give students more options when processing content that is being explained. Due to the increase in school technologies, the final solution would be widely accessible by anyone at any time, whether it is in the school’s computer lab, the students’/educators’ devices or even by someone looking to discover or rediscover some concepts outside of the education department.
