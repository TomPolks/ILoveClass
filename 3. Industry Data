Q3. Has your opinion of your ideal job changed? Why or why not?


Our opinion of our ideal jobs have not changed. We realise that, if we want to be successful and do what we want, we need to attempt to gather and improve upon the skills we already have and that we need for our ideal jobs. While some skills are more difficult to acquire than others, it is important that we possess as many skills as possible so that we can be the most successful in our ideal jobs as we can be.
