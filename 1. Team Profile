Basic Background Info: My nationality is Chinese. I studied at Salesian College Chadstone from 2013 until 2018, I am not currently studying at RMIT doing a bachelorâ€™s degree. At home I speak Indonesian, a dialect of Chinese called Teo Chew and English, although I have also learned some Chinese in the past. One interesting fact about me is that I can play 3 instruments; Piano, guitar and drums. I enjoy playing PC games and playing sports such as volleyball and basketball.
