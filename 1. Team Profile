I’m 25 years of age and was born in Melbourne Australia, I have grown up here all my life and I’m of mixed European background (Italian, French, Croatian, Dutch and Irish), but only speak English. After high school I went to Tafe and completed a diploma of IT and then moved on to a Bachelor of Digital Media, after a while I decided that I didn’t want to pursue this career and decided to just find a job somewhere, so for the last 3-4 years I have just being working. I enjoy spending time with my mates, weather it be going out to eat, going to music festivals or just staying home and playing games.
