Ideal Job (link unavailable):
My ideal job will unlikely be at the advertised company and location, however, the responsibilities of the role makes it ideal. The qualities of this job that make it appealling is the ability to contribute to a fully functional game that has many users. However, I like the elements of working with a team, experimenting with old and new ideas, programming a game and being able to see the differences between a prototype from behind the scenes to the final product.

Personally, my ideal job would be able to work as an animator and art designer for a company, notably video games or an animated series. I thoroughly enjoy drawing and designing things as the feeling of satisfaction of finishing a piece of work that you’re proud of is extremely addictive. It allows me to do work in my life whilst doing what I enjoy the most.
