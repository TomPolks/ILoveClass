Steven's group reflection:
The communication between group members was consistent and easy with one group chat. Decision making was quick and didn't drag on for long. Everyone agreed and took responsibility for a specific task of the assignment.
Some things that could be improved is the consistency of the use of GitHub. While everyone was doing their part of the assignment, there only a few uploads of work completed or being worked on. Only until the past few weeks of the due date did group members start regularly updating their part of the assignments on GitHub.
There were a few people in the group who took charge and came up with solutions that was fair for all members of the group. The ability of the group to quickly make decisions on certain parts of the assignment, such as who was responsible for a section of the assignment, was quite surprising.
One thing I have learned about working in a group is patience and trust. Other group members may have had other commitments or work to do so being patient and trusting that all the members will do their part is important when being part of a group.
