Steven's group reflection:
The communication between group members was consistent and easy with one group chat. Decision making was quick and didn't drag on for long. Everyone agreed and took responsibility for a specific task of the assignment.
Some things that could be improved is the consistency of the use of GitHub. While everyone was doing their part of the assignment, there only a few uploads of work completed or being worked on. Only until the past few weeks of the due date did group members start regularly updating their part of the assignments on GitHub.
There were a few people in the group who took charge and came up with solutions that was fair for all members of the group. The ability of the group to quickly make decisions on certain parts of the assignment, such as who was responsible for a section of the assignment, was quite surprising.
One thing I have learned about working in a group is patience and trust. Other group members may have had other commitments or work to do so being patient and trusting that all the members will do their part is important when being part of a group.

Overall, our group has had no issues working together on completing our respective tasks that we had been assigned. We ensured we had a proper means of communication using the Messenger function on Facebook which we used often whenever we needed to discuss things, ask questions or even ask others to submit their work onto github. Another member and I of the group were assigned to write up two reports each of about 1.5k words for each report. I believe I delivered on this to the best of my ability. One thing I do think that most, if not everyone in the group could have done, would be to have begun to assignment much sooner and completed work at a consistent rate rather than just the last week till its due date. 
A factor that did come into account, however, was that some people are busy during mid-semester break due to work and other family obligations, during the mid-semester break, regular school weeks and weekends.

Aaron's group reflection:
Within the group, everything went well, the communication within the group had no issues as we have created a group chat for us to discuss and problems or any work that was needed to be done. This allowed the group to have constant connection with each other to talk about if there was anything that needed to be done. Although everything went well there were things that could be improved such as the times when some of the work was not yet completed to be added into the report. However, this was not too much of a problem as the work would be completed in the next few hours or days. One thing that was surprising to me was how well the group worked together to get things done on time, for if the group was less communicative it would have been harder to get the work together to be put into the report. While in the group I have learned that most of us had very similar career choices to become a developer, or another part of the IT industry.
