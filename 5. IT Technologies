-== Duane - Clouds, services, servers ==-
Cloud services and cloud servers are essentially large wide area networks (WAN) that is connected through the internet so it can be accessed remotely from almost anywhere with a connection to the internet and from many devices that it may support. These devices include, but not subject to, smartphones (iPhone series, Samsung Galaxy series, etc), laptops, desktops and tablets (iPad series, etc). These devices can connect to an online connection and thus access these cloud servers of services. 
One of the best cloud services currently in out world would be Google Drive. Google Drive is a cloud storage service that offers a range of options depending on what you would like to store. 
Google Drive also has a few apps that are supported greatly by Google Drive such as Google Docs for word documents, Google Slides for presentations, Google Spreadsheet for spreadsheet and data. Furthermore, Google Drive also has other services such as Gmail which is an email application and Google Photos for photographs and other pictures. 
Google Drive is known for this exact versatility in many services such as the examples stated previously, although these are not the only services Google Drive offers, there are quite a few others. 
Overall, you can store pretty much anything in Google Drive such as photos, videos, Microsoft Office files, PDF’s, etc. Google Drive does have a few limits in terms of storing files, however they’re incredibly generous and most users would probably never notice these limits. An example of these limits would be the character limit on document files such as Google Docs and Microsoft Word. However, the limit is approximately 1.02 million characters in length. Furthermore, presentation files such as Google Slides and Microsoft Powerpoint, can only be 100MB at maximum. In addition to this, most files can only be 5TB (5000GB) in size. 
Another useful feature is that you may choose to store attachments that you receive bymail though Gmail automatically into Google Drive. However, it is also important to keep in mind that everything in Google Drive shares a single pool of storage. 
Google Drive also grants you the ability to ‘preview’ files that have been stored such as photos and videos without the need of downloading that file first. 
Since technology is constantly evolving in todays world, the way computers work, what technologies, software and hardware is used continually changed and will likely to do so over the next few years and the foreseeable future. Cloud servers and Cloud services are no different. It has been predicted by Mike Smith, Founder of AeroComInc.com, that the cloud will play a vital role in the way businesses work in the future. Smith claims that smaller companies will no longer need to purchase full desktops towers and the such when all they would need would be to “simply buy a monitor, keyboard, mouse and a thin client (which basically controls the keyboard, mouse & monitor)”. He continues to discuss the possibility of potential businesses in the future to have a much simpler workstation for employees to work off due to programs and other files that the company owning being handled by a third-party cloud provider. 
Cloud services and servers are possible today due to the constant evolution of technology. Namely, the internet itself. The internet can be considered a giant cloud network where millions of devices connect to for information, constantly uploading and downloading all sorts of information. The cloud is made possible due to the evolution of the internet and networks, namely WANs (Wide Area Networks.). Our ability to continually improve the internet has led it to becoming more reliable and better suited for the many tasks and problems we encounter every day. Cloud computing will only get better over time alongside the evolution of the internet as we know it. 


The potential impact of cloud computing is that it may replace a lot of services that we use in modern society. A typical example would be the use of DVDs and CDs. Although they are still widely popular, they are not as big as they were a few years ago with the introduction of Spotify and Netflix. Instead of purchasing a physical copy of their desired music, TV-Show or movie, users can now choose to just stream these files directly from a cloud network that the respective companies use for their product. This is widely regarded as more useful and convenient for the user to simply watch or listen to whatever they like at any given time compared to the hassle that purchasing a physical disc that forces the user to committing to extra steps such as inserting the disc into a player. 
It is likely that many other things in modern society such as businesses will begin to or adapt more of the cloud services capabilities. A wide variety of businesses are beginning to (if not already) use cloud services for their needs, even as basic as their files onto a cloud network to be accessed from a wider variety of places, an employee’s home and their company’s workplace. This can potentially grow into a company’s entire business being run off a cloud network, without the need for employees to travel to a workplace, where all the files and programs that a company needs to function can simply be accessed from anywhere on their cloud network. 
Within the foreseeable future, cloud computing is likely to evolve continually as it slowly becomes a standard in many cases. Many industries and companies will incorporate cloud computing into their method of functionality in some shape or form to help make it easier and more convenient for everyone to access files. 
However, with the evolution of cloud computing to make it easier to use for everyone, comes increased security risks that comes with it as more and more people will likely rely on it for their personal information. An issue that Google Drive faces with its known privacy issues. Furthermore, this increase in use of cloud computing increases the amount of risks and threats such as hackers who may attempt to steal information for malevolent reasons. The internet in the future may become more and more dangerous and modern society continues to rely on it. 
With Cloud computing progressing in technology and use, comes the concern of current jobs and technologies being used in modern society. Cloud computing may both replace and create jobs for people. Maintenance for the many devices that keeps a cloud service running will increase drastically as the security and other unknown threats to cloud services and servers will also rise as cloud computing becomes more and more integrated into our way of life. Program developers may also increase in jobs as people are always finding ways to improve the many things of cloud computing such as security, reliability and its capabilities. Technologies that can support cloud computing will also increase in demand as companies and other users always want a better system for their own uses to increase reliability and efficiency of their cloud service. 
The production of physical discs is likely to decrease as cloud services such as Netflix and Spotify continue to outweigh physical DVDs and CDs in terms of convenience and ease of use. Although, the number of jobs that cloud computing creates arguably is much greater than the loss of jobs from physical disc manufacturers and disc player such as Blu-ray players. 


Cloud services already affects me in my daily life. I use Netflix and other streaming services that I find on the internet to watch a movie or a tv-series whenever I feel like it and I have the time to. Furthermore, since I play on my Xbox One as one of my primary entertainment sources, I use one of their services called ‘Xbox Game Pass’ which allows me to download video games off the website for free and play them whenever I desire. Furthermore, an anticipated feature is the ability to stream video games at will, without the need to download it onto a storage unit first. 
In the foreseeable future, I see myself using cloud services such as Google Drive much more often to collaborate with fellow students at RMIT University. I also see myself using more and more cloud services such as Netflix much more often in stark comparison to purchasing a physical disc for watching movies and tv-series. This increases my convenience and efficiency when performing things that I find enjoyment. 
Similar to me, majority of my family and friends also use cloud services on a regular basis as it has become a part of the way we live and do things. My family and I share an account of Netflix and Stan, a competitor to Netflix, to watch all sorts of movies and tv-shows. My mother and father likely use cloud services to store data when they’re at work so it can be shared to the other employees to process whilst they receive data from them in return.
