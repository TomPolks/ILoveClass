-== Duane - Clouds, services, servers ==-

Cloud services and cloud servers are essentially large wide area networks (WAN) that is connected through the internet so it can be accessed remotely from almost anywhere with a connection to the internet and from many devices that it may support. These devices include, but not subject to, smartphones (iPhone series, Samsung Galaxy series, etc), laptops, desktops and tablets (iPad series, etc). These devices can connect to an online connection and thus access these cloud servers of services. 
One of the best cloud services currently in out world would be Google Drive. Google Drive is a cloud storage service that offers a range of options depending on what you would like to store. 
Google Drive also has a few apps that are supported greatly by Google Drive such as Google Docs for word documents, Google Slides for presentations, Google Spreadsheet for spreadsheet and data. Furthermore, Google Drive also has other services such as Gmail which is an email application and Google Photos for photographs and other pictures. 
Google Drive is known for this exact versatility in many services such as the examples stated previously, although these are not the only services Google Drive offers, there are quite a few others. 
Overall, you can store pretty much anything in Google Drive such as photos, videos, Microsoft Office files, PDF’s, etc. Google Drive does have a few limits in terms of storing files, however they’re incredibly generous and most users would probably never notice these limits. An example of these limits would be the character limit on document files such as Google Docs and Microsoft Word. However, the limit is approximately 1.02 million characters in length. Furthermore, presentation files such as Google Slides and Microsoft Powerpoint, can only be 100MB at maximum. In addition to this, most files can only be 5TB (5000GB) in size. 
Another useful feature is that you may choose to store attachments that you receive bymail though Gmail automatically into Google Drive. However, it is also important to keep in mind that everything in Google Drive shares a single pool of storage. 
Google Drive also grants you the ability to ‘preview’ files that have been stored such as photos and videos without the need of downloading that file first. 
Since technology is constantly evolving in todays world, the way computers work, what technologies, software and hardware is used continually changed and will likely to do so over the next few years and the foreseeable future. Cloud servers and Cloud services are no different. It has been predicted by Mike Smith, Founder of AeroComInc.com, that the cloud will play a vital role in the way businesses work in the future. Smith claims that smaller companies will no longer need to purchase full desktops towers and the such when all they would need would be to “simply buy a monitor, keyboard, mouse and a thin client (which basically controls the keyboard, mouse & monitor)”. He continues to discuss the possibility of potential businesses in the future to have a much simpler workstation for employees to work off due to programs and other files that the company owning being handled by a third-party cloud provider. 
Cloud services and servers are possible today due to the constant evolution of technology. Namely, the internet itself. The internet can be considered a giant cloud network where millions of devices connect to for information, constantly uploading and downloading all sorts of information. The cloud is made possible due to the evolution of the internet and networks, namely WANs (Wide Area Networks.). Our ability to continually improve the internet has led it to becoming more reliable and better suited for the many tasks and problems we encounter every day. Cloud computing will only get better over time alongside the evolution of the internet as we know it. 


The potential impact of cloud computing is that it may replace a lot of services that we use in modern society. A typical example would be the use of DVDs and CDs. Although they are still widely popular, they are not as big as they were a few years ago with the introduction of Spotify and Netflix. Instead of purchasing a physical copy of their desired music, TV-Show or movie, users can now choose to just stream these files directly from a cloud network that the respective companies use for their product. This is widely regarded as more useful and convenient for the user to simply watch or listen to whatever they like at any given time compared to the hassle that purchasing a physical disc that forces the user to committing to extra steps such as inserting the disc into a player. 
It is likely that many other things in modern society such as businesses will begin to or adapt more of the cloud services capabilities. A wide variety of businesses are beginning to (if not already) use cloud services for their needs, even as basic as their files onto a cloud network to be accessed from a wider variety of places, an employee’s home and their company’s workplace. This can potentially grow into a company’s entire business being run off a cloud network, without the need for employees to travel to a workplace, where all the files and programs that a company needs to function can simply be accessed from anywhere on their cloud network. 
Within the foreseeable future, cloud computing is likely to evolve continually as it slowly becomes a standard in many cases. Many industries and companies will incorporate cloud computing into their method of functionality in some shape or form to help make it easier and more convenient for everyone to access files. 
However, with the evolution of cloud computing to make it easier to use for everyone, comes increased security risks that comes with it as more and more people will likely rely on it for their personal information. An issue that Google Drive faces with its known privacy issues. Furthermore, this increase in use of cloud computing increases the amount of risks and threats such as hackers who may attempt to steal information for malevolent reasons. The internet in the future may become more and more dangerous and modern society continues to rely on it. 
With Cloud computing progressing in technology and use, comes the concern of current jobs and technologies being used in modern society. Cloud computing may both replace and create jobs for people. Maintenance for the many devices that keeps a cloud service running will increase drastically as the security and other unknown threats to cloud services and servers will also rise as cloud computing becomes more and more integrated into our way of life. Program developers may also increase in jobs as people are always finding ways to improve the many things of cloud computing such as security, reliability and its capabilities. Technologies that can support cloud computing will also increase in demand as companies and other users always want a better system for their own uses to increase reliability and efficiency of their cloud service. 
The production of physical discs is likely to decrease as cloud services such as Netflix and Spotify continue to outweigh physical DVDs and CDs in terms of convenience and ease of use. Although, the number of jobs that cloud computing creates arguably is much greater than the loss of jobs from physical disc manufacturers and disc player such as Blu-ray players. 


Cloud services already affects me in my daily life. I use Netflix and other streaming services that I find on the internet to watch a movie or a tv-series whenever I feel like it and I have the time to. Furthermore, since I play on my Xbox One as one of my primary entertainment sources, I use one of their services called ‘Xbox Game Pass’ which allows me to download video games off the website for free and play them whenever I desire. Furthermore, an anticipated feature is the ability to stream video games at will, without the need to download it onto a storage unit first. 
In the foreseeable future, I see myself using cloud services such as Google Drive much more often to collaborate with fellow students at RMIT University. I also see myself using more and more cloud services such as Netflix much more often in stark comparison to purchasing a physical disc for watching movies and tv-series. This increases my convenience and efficiency when performing things that I find enjoyment. 
Similar to me, majority of my family and friends also use cloud services on a regular basis as it has become a part of the way we live and do things. My family and I share an account of Netflix and Stan, a competitor to Netflix, to watch all sorts of movies and tv-shows. My mother and father likely use cloud services to store data when they’re at work so it can be shared to the other employees to process whilst they receive data from them in return.

-== Duane - Cybersecurity ==-

Cybersecurity eludes to a user’s privacy and security on electronic devices such as mobiles and computers. There are many things that can be implemented to increase cyber security from notorious things on the internet such as viruses and spyware. Cybersecurity can refer to either the common countermeasures that users on the internet can use to increase their cyber security online. Another countermeasure to increase one’s cyber security would be using software to protect a device from malicious threats. One of the recommended software programs that a user can install would be Fidelis Deception. This software is designed to create false documents and files to lure hackers and other threats to them to protect the real data. This software is specifically designed to create convincing and legitimate looking decoy files as usually a threat may be able to tell the difference between a fake trail and a real trail that leads to the user’s data. 
However, there are quite a few people who would argue that the best security would be to know how to surf the internet in a proper and safe manner. Some extremely basic precautions when browsing the web would be to avoid any sketchy looking websites at all costs and to avoid viewing emails that are not from a trustworthy sender. Knowing how to use the internet in a appropriate manner can help avoid encountering any proper issues completely that it removes the need for an anti-virus software. 
In the future, as modern technology continues to evolve further and further, the impact technology has on our daily lives also continues to grow, thus the need for cybersecurity also drastically increases. Even today, cybersecurity has brought upon some debatable moments when referring to privacy. Facebook is an example of this. Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg faced the US Congress due to a data-mining company named ‘Cambridge Analytica” who are affiliated with Donald Trump and using information from the privacy of 87 million Facebook users to influence elections. Obviously, this caused a major outrage from users of Facebook who directed their rage to Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook for his failure to prevent third parties from accessing their private data. This is a prime example of just how vital cybersecurity is on the internet, especially on popular social media platforms such as Facebook. 
Any data that is being transferred onto the internet in some form has a chance of being attacked or stolen by a malicious user or threat. Any technological advance that involves the internet nowadays, cybersecurity must meet to be able to protect it. Cybersecurity has been a thing for quite a while, even before the internet came into fruition. The military, government, private organizations and more used ‘private networks’ for their own uses. However, one of the first common security issues came when others needed to join a network. The network itself would have to be set to public so users can see and connect to it. This raised the main problem on how your network can truly be ‘private’ if everyone can see it. These cybersecurity issues will only continue to increase as technology evolves and malicious users continually try to find new ways to infiltrate your device or network for whatever reason. 
Cybersecurity must continue to evolve to protect the data of users on the internet as it evolves in the foreseeable future. The importance of cybersecurity will only grow as the internet and technology continues to be integrated into our daily lives. 


Cybersecurity has helped keep the privacy, key information and other kinds of files available to the right people only. However, these security measures are in place due to the potential hazards and dangers that the internet can create such as the sharing of information about people without their consent. An example of how letting out the private information of a user can have negative impacts is if someone chooses to commit fraud and pose as another user before committing a criminal act. Of course, increased cybersecurity will only lead to notorious hackers to scurry and find any potential holes in the security wall that has been set to infiltrate and get their hands on a user’s personal data such as credit card information. 
Cybersecurity can only go so far, as there is bound to be a method of some sort for others to infiltrate the system. Cybersecurity’s goal is to make it as hard as possible for potential threats to gain unauthorized access to the data. This can be done through various methods such as encryption. Encryption is a method of locking something behind a password of some kind before it can be properly accessed. Most companies use a common password set by their employees to safeguard each employee’s data to prevent others from accessing each other’s data. Much more advanced encryptions are used for more important data such as Facebook that uses encryption to protect the storage that stores user data provided through Facebook. Over the years, encryption has improved, making it harder and harder for people to decipher and decrypt certain keys to databases that stores all sorts of information. 
Cybersecurity will only continue to improve in the future as technology continues to progress through many technological stages. As technology gets better and better and more integrated into our lives, the importance of cybersecurity will increase further and further. However, this also means that cybersecurity will also have no choice but to increase its efficiency and effectiveness against all malicious threats. 
As cybersecurity continues to grow as part of the many technological advances that our society experiences. Practically every user of the internet will be affected by the many changed that come. Increased cybersecurity will mean that a user may have to insert more drastic countermeasures in the future to properly safeguard their information. Passwords used to be the most common encryptions on most devices, however now there are many other ways to lock a device or network without a specific ‘key’ of some sort to unlock it. Examples of these special encryption methods would be fingerprint scanners that many laptops and smartphones use to identify a user and thus grant that specific user access to the device. It’s possible that society will have to begin using similar types of encryption such as face recognition, fingerprint scanner, iris scanner, etc. to properly safeguard and ensure the safety of their data or device. 
Since technology continually advances and progressed every year, the need for increased and improved cybersecurity will also drastically increase. This results in a spike increase in demand of developers and programmers who can create better and better encryption and security method and software to prevent ill-natured users from infiltrating networks and devices and potentially cause harm. This will in turn, make past technologies and encryption methods redundant as society no longer needs them as it will possibly make their data too vulnerable to threats. This may lead to a loss of jobs of the people who do create these encryption and security methods that have become redundant. Although, it is likely they will find a new job or improve their current methods of security to be on par with other types of cybersecurity and to be able to defend against the many threats that will also evolve as technology evolves. 


The use of cybersecurity affects me in my everyday life in almost all the major devices that I use. My smartphone and my laptop contain encryption that is harder to be bypassed by other users such as a password. Although, my smartphone also uses a finger-print scanner as a method of checking security before granting access to the user of that device. It is extremely likely that cybersecurity will continue to be a thing in my everyday life as I live in a society that relies heavily on technology. It is equally as likely however, that I will have to change my methods of security in the future such as the passwords I use on my social media accounts incase my current password becomes too unreliable. 
In a modern society like my own that relies on technology as a part of our everyday lives, cybersecurity will always be a key factor in protecting all the data that we upload and download from the internet on a daily basis. My family and friends are not exempt from this. They too, use technology constantly, in work, school and for entertainment. Cybersecurity will be a key thing in all of our lives for likely the rest of our lives in protecting our privacy and data from harm.

-== Jacky - Robots ==-

What does it do? (600 words) What is the state of the art of this new technology? What can
be done now? What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)? What
technological or other developments make this possible?
Robots have always played a role in our lives, whether it for commercial use or business wise, robots and machinery has always made our lives easier. With new technology and invention being made to deal with modern problems, robots have been a part of the equation. While we can see that robots are used in everyday situation, robots are also used in other fields, from medical field to military, their role are endless. Most recently, the Da Vinci robot has made headline from social media with a video presenting a Da Vinci robot removing a grape skin and resewing the skin back. This demonstrates to the world that robots are capable of preforming operation in the medical field, being more beneficial than an actual doctor, with their “hands” being more precise and steadier than human doctors. However, robots lack one thing, a conscience, and because they might not understand what is going on at that moment, they could mess up or only do what its programmed to do, that is why robots are only used in smaller, minor situation. But in future time, with new programing or invention, robots may learn how to adapt in situation and preform in different condition. in the next coming years, advancements will be made to improve robots to be able to perform in those situations to make lives more easier for the user. Robots are likely to replace or help in though situation, for example, the recent news of the Notre Dame fire had enlisted the help of a recently built robot, “Colossus”, who was designed to be firefighting robot and was able to enter into the dangerous area and fight the devastating fire. The use of the robot was able to not only prevent innocent people to a dangerous area but also extinguishe the fire with its high-powered cannon without ever going back out. From this event and in the future, many developers will develop robots that will deal with jobs that are dangerous to humans. From these examples we can see that robots are capable to preforming jobs in hazardous condition while preforming pinpoint actions than actual human people. What makes this possible is the developers themselves. Developers have to make sure that the robot is built to solve that problems, and with modern problems appearing more, modern solution is the answer, and to make this happen, developers need to improve on “artificial intelligence”. If developers are able to improve or make developments on AI, the robots will not only be able to preform the task, but will ‘learn’ from it, and adapt from it, making robots the superior choice for that task.


What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development?
What is likely to change? Which people will be most affected and how? Will this create,
replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?

the impact of robots can be both positive and negative to the world. 
Some positive impact is that robots are that robots can improve on life qualities, making our lives easier. This can be already seen through SIRI from apple and Alexa from Amazon, which user use to store any information to it, giving more time for the user to do other things. For commercial use, robots are beneficial for everyday jobs that human will see as a bothersome and allow human more free time to do other task. Robots can also be used for dangerous situation, just like the last question, robots can be used as a replacement for humans to reduce the risk of lives, while also outperforming humans in their own jobs.
However, some negative things that robots may impact  is that robots can replace human jobs, replacing human resource to robots, giving less opportunity to humans. This will most likely impact anyone as their job could be replace by a robot, who could be better at performing their job than themselves. This would leave many people out of job and will make people furious about the situation and most likely turn against robots, who was made to make  people lives easier. 
How will this affect you? (300 words) In your daily life, how will this affect you? What
will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?
For me personally, robots, in my daily life makes it easier for me. From when I wake up through the use of the phone alarm, to when I catch public transport to get to university or to when I do my school work through school computer/laptop, robots makes my life easier, doing task which I find bothersome. What makes it different for me is that robots has been around my life, it’s difficult to tell what task I’m have done and what was robots have done. How this affects my family and friends is that their use of robots, whether in phones or somewhere else, also benefits them, for example, my parents own a butcher shop in which a program is required to record any sales and money record that the shop makes, making my parents jobs easier and allowing them to focus on other things.
